            <p>The “Freedom Project” for SEP10 is all about how sep connects to other industries. We have to pick a topic that we're passionate about and use HTML, CSS , Bootstrap, and a tool that we picked to create a website about our topic. </p>
            <p>For my project, I made a website about advertising. In order to make the website, I research a lots of information about advertising like the hardware and softwares. After that I used HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and Aframe to create and design my website. </p>
            <p>The main takeaways from this project is that I learned how to learn stuff on my own. Before I made my website I had to learn aframe and I had to learn it all by myself. I searched for tutorials and websites that can help me learn aframe and I try to change the codes to undertsnad what does the code do. There was also some challenges when I was making my website. The biggest challenge is that I couldn't think of a way to use aframe to make a scene that can show my future invention, so I used another skill that I learned which is "learn how to research". I search for many websites and videos and found an aframe component called environment. It can change the background of your scene so I thought I can use this to show what it would look like when people use my future invention idea, which is a headset that can bring people into the virtual reality world and allow them to test out the product that the company is advertising. After solving that problem, my website is finally complete and I can use the skills I learned during this project in the future because I will definitely need to learn stuff on my own and research for stuff in the future. </p>
